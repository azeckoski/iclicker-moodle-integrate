This is the Moodle 1.x i>clicker integrate plugin which integrates Moodle 1.x with iClicker (http://www.iclicker.com/dnn/)
The plugin allows students to register their clickers with the Moodle 1.x installation. It provides
an adminstrative interface for managing the registrations for Moodle admins. Instructors are provided
with a reporting view which allows them to view a listing of the students in their courses which have
and have not registered clickers. The plugin also provides integration with the i>clicker and i>grader
desktop applications and allows direct grade import and export from the Moodle course gradebook.

Download the current release of the plugin from the moodle plugins directory:
